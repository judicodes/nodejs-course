# Node.js Course
This repository contains some subfolders with projects that I worked on when taking the course "Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2024
" by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

The implementation differs from the course because

a) some parts of the course were outdated and

b) I decided to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript and

c) I went with ES6 syntax instead of CommonJS.
